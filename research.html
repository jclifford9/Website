    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
      The Stewart group studies the dynamics of atom-diatom collisions both
      computationally and experimentally.
      While all atomic interactions are inherently quantum, 
      the Li<sub>2</sub>(A<sup>1</sup>&#931<sub>u</sub><sup style="position: relative; left: -.5em;">+</sup>)-rare gas systems 
      we study are highly classical, so we can extract valuable information from 
      classical treatment in addition to our exact quantum mechanical calculations.
      Our group has the ability to study detailed classical trajectories, run computationally expensive quantum calculations on 
      Wesleyan's high performance computing center (HPCC), and analyze experimental collision data when we study a given system. 
      This threefold method of investigation allows the group to be rather thorough in our work. 

    </p>
    <h4>Computational</h4>
    <p>
      Our group primarily uses a classical trajectory program written in 
      by Dr. Neil Smith to study collisions in a quasi-classical manner.
      The program makes use of action angle variables, which have been shown to significantly reduce computational time and allows 
      us to trivially determine the final rovibronic states (denoted by the vibrational and rotational quantum 
      numbers <em>v</em> and <em>j</em> ) of our molecules. We use a modified harmonic oscillator 
      to model the diatomic interaction and have an array of choices for the modeling of collisions.
      The most common way we model our collision system is with an <em>ab initio</em> potential surface (one 
      that is calculated from the principles of quantum mechanics) because they strongly agree with experimental results.
      With Dr. Smith's program and our suite of analysis tools, we have been able to gain many insights into the 
      dyanmics of the collisions of small molecules. Additionally, a cool feature of the trajectory program is the 
      ability to make "collision movies" where one can see what a given interaction looks like classically. A 
      screenshot taken from a Li<sub>2</sub>(A<sup>1</sup>&#931<sub>u</sub><sup style="position: relative; left: -.5em;">+</sup>)-Xe 
      collision movie is shown above. 
    </p>
    <h4>Experimental</h4>
    <p>
      Our group uses a dispersed laser induced fluorescence procedure to
      determine absolute level-to-level rate coefficients. First, we use a
      continuous-wave single-frequency laser to prepare the molecules into a
      single electronically excited rovibrational state (a specific <em>v<sub>i</sub> , j<sub>i</sub></em>
      combination). Then we examine the resulting spectrum, which consists of strong
      "parent lines" from the fluorescence of molecules from the laser-excited
      state and weaker "satellite lines" from the fluorescence of molecules that
      were laser-excited and subsequently excited via a collision. We then use
      the data from the experimentally determined parent and satellite line
      intensities in calculating our level-resolved rate constants.
    </p>
    <img class="vid" controls src="expt_concept.png" controls style="width: 30%" />
    <p>
      The figure above has been adapted from one created by Dr. Stewart and is a helpful 
      tool in visualizing our experimental procedure. Transition (A) shows the laser exciting 
      molecules into their first electronic excited state. From that point the molecules that 
      do not undergo a collision while excited fluoresce (parent lines) to another level 
      of the ground state (C). Those that do undergo a collision are raised to a higher excited 
      state (B) and then fluoresce (satellite lines) to a different level of the ground state (D).
    </p>
    <h3>Initial Work</h3>
    <p>
      Part of my initial training once joining the lab consisted of assisting our lab's
      graduate student, Denuwan Vithanage, thermally stabilize our etalon. The group's laser 
      previously had long-term stability issues, but when Denuwan still observed a frequency drift after 
      attempts to stabilize the laser, he decided it would be 
      best to investigate our measurement apparatus. I then helped him conduct temperature 
      measurements and insulate our etalon. In short time, it was seen that our laser was stable.
    </p>
    <p>
      My subsequent task was to characterize our group's CCD camera, which outputs the 
      molecular spectra that we analyze to extract rate constants. The camera, like all other 
      detection apparatuses, innately outputs noise. My job was to attain a better understanding of 
      how the camera works and develop a stretegy to adjust our data taking procedure to enhance our 
      signal to noise ratio. After both of those tasks were completed, the group was able to 
      move on with confidence to pursue Denuwan's benchmark experiments on microscopic reversibility.
    </p>
    <h3>MA Project: Vibrational Energy Transfer</h3>
    <p>
      There exist two mechanisms of vibrational energy transfer in atom-diatom collision systems. The first is 
      called the end impact mechanism. These collisions involve the incoming atom striking an end of the diatom, inducing a 
      compression that in turn vibrationally excites the diatom. This mechanism is well-known and is the standard way of modelling
      vibrational energy transfer in our systems. 
      The second mechanism is the side impact; these collisions involve the projectile atom colliding with the 
      diatom on a trajectory that is nearly perpendicular to the diatomic bond. This perpendicular strike excites molecular vibration 
      by expanding the diatomic bond. The side impact mechanism is significantly less well-known than the end impact, and my MA work
      will aid in shrinking this knowldge gap by characterizing the side impact mechanism.
    </p>
    <p>
      This work will be both computational and experimental. Computational work will range from analyzing the
      results of Monte Carlo simulations of millions of classical trajectories to studying single collisions.
      Analysis from the computational work will not only provide dynamical insights but also guidance on 
      which systems we should experimentally investigate. While our group has previously published experimental
      evidence for the significance of the side impact mechanism, this work aims to substantially strengthen 
      that evidence and provide benchmark experimental results in the study of the side impact mechanism.
      One of the applications of this work is modeling energy flow in out-of-equilibrium 
      gases. Some interesting cases of such gases are those excited by the 
      shockwaves from supersonic flight and atmospheric entry of a spacecraft. A more complete   
      understanding of those systems is especially vital to organizations like NASA, which has 
      previously supported our group's work.</p>

    <h3>Optical Transparency of Graphene</h3>
    <p>
      My first task at ORNL was to conduct a literature search for and draft
      sections of a paper (work remains unpublished) regarding the optical
      transparency of graphene in the vacuum ultraviolet regime (VUV). The group
      investigated this topic to evalute graphene's potential to be used as a
      low-cost VUV photodetector. The group is interested in the VUV wavelengths
      because scintillators based on liquid noble gases are commonly used for
      detection in particle physics experiments, and liquified noble gases
      scintillate in the VUV regime. Such experiments include but are not
      limited to neutrino physics, neutrinoless double beta decay, and dark
      matter searches. There are multiple ways to detect VUV photons in these
      experiments, but with the increasing scales of these experiments it is
      becoming increasingly expensive to do so directly (without using a
      wavelength shifter). Many of the proposed low-cost designs use a planar
      photodiode configuration where an NP junction lies between two electrodes.
      In order to detect VUV photons, one of the electrodes must be transparent
      to VUV light. Graphene is known to be nealry transparent (<a
        href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1156965"
        >a single layer is ~98% transparent</a
      >) in the visible regime, but since liquid argon scintillates at 128nm,
      which is well below the lower wavelength cutoff for visible light, further study was
      needed to determine graphene's VUV transparency. The group examined the
      optical transparency of single and multi-layer graphene in the range of
      115 to 350nm, and the results were promising for graphene's use as a
      low-cost VUV photodetector.

    <h3>Assembly of 3D-Printed Scintillation Detectors</h3>
    <p>
      The next project I worked on was the assembly of 3D-printed scintillation
      detectors. My work began with a study of a model adhesive (one with similar properties to the proposed adhesive). 
      The investigation yielded sufficient data to configure the settings of the adhesive dispenser that was ultimately used in the assembly process.
      I then determined the most efficient and material-conserving workflow for the fabrication procedure. 
      Following the conclusing of my work the process became successfully fully automated with an arduino-controlled adhesive dispenser and 
      a robotic arm to carry out the assembly.
    </p>
    <h3>Calibration and Preparation of Stilbene Radiation Detectors</h3>
    <p>My final project at ORNL involved calibrating stilbene radiation detectors for use in a 
      nuclear physics experiment at the University of Notre Dame. These detectors have an array 
      of applications from research to nuclear nonproliferation. Crystalline stilbene is an organic 
      scintillator that is highly sensitive to fast neutrons (those with a kinetic energy above 1 MeV) 
      in a gamma ray background. The stilbene detectors used in this experiment only made up a subset 
      of the suite of instruments that were used for data collection, which also included gamma ray and 
      charged particle detectors. The stilbene detectors, all of which were coupled to photomultiplier tubes (PMTs), can be 
      seen above my head in the picture on my homepage. Since the experimental procedure involved 
      collecting data at different energy levels, the detectors needed to be calibrated such that 
      that they didn't saturate at the higher energies or have too low of a signal to noise ratio at 
      lower energies. In order to avoid both of these potential shortcomings, the plan was to change the voltages of the detectors 
      as the energy changed in order to extract the highest quality data possible. A Cs-137 radiation source was used to 
      generate pulse height spectra for each detector at varying voltage settings. This calibration 
      data provided us sufficient information to calculate the optimal voltages for each detector for each 
      energy studied in the experiment.</p>

    <h2>Wave Transport in Complex Systems Laboratory (Wesleyan)</h2>
    <p>
      While part of Dr. Kottos's group, my project focused on sublinear sensing.
      Most sensors are linear in that their response signal is directly
      proportional to the input perturbation. We see in the figure below that if one wanted to
      construct a linear sensor that was especially sensitive to small
      perturbations, then they would have to significantly reduce the sensor's
      dyanmic range (the ratio of the maximum and minimum perturbations that a
      sensor can measure). However, it is demonstrated that if the sensor has a sublinear response, then
      it will have an expanded dynamic range and augmented sensitivity to small
      perturbations in comparison to a linear sensor. From this, one can clearly
      see the advantages that come with a nonlinear sensing device.
    </p>
    <img class="vid" controls src="Sensing.png" controls style="width: 30%" />
    <p>
      The method we used to realize such a scheme was to implement a setup based
      on Wigner's Cusp Anomalies (WCAs). These cusps are characterized by an
      output variable that is proportional to the square root of its input
      variable. WCAs are more formally defined as square-root singularites in
      the differential scattering cross section around the energy threshold of a
      newly opened channel. While they were first studied in the context of
      nuclear physics, WCAs also manifest themselves in other settings such as
      quantum mechanics, optics, and photonics. Our work showed that these cusps
      can be used in more than isolation: we demonstrated setups that exhibited
      two-sided cusps as well as systems with multiple unique cusps. Two-sided
      cusps are especially advantageous as they are hyper-sensitive in both the
      positive and negaitve directions, making them ideal for sensing
      observables such as acceleration or rotation. Setups with multiple cusps
      are characteristic of multimode systems; they allow for simultaneous,
      enhanced sensing of multiple independent observables.
    </p>

      As part of our theoretical study, we conducted both numerical simulations
      and COMSOL Multiphysics simulations. Results of each of the simulations
      are included in the poster I produced for the project. I encourage you to
      view the poster and accompanying overview video for more information on
      this project (both can be seen below). For more information on Dr.
