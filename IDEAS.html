    <h1>IDEAS Minor Portfolio</h1>
    <p>
      Below I have assembled projects and portfolios from the courses I have
      completed in Wesleyan's Integrated Design, Engineering, Arts, and Society
      (IDEAS) program. I enjoyed all of my IDEAS courses and learned many
      practical skills and software programs through them. The software I
      learned in my IDEAS courses includes Arduino; Ultimaker Cura; Solidworks;
      and Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, and After Effects. I then made use of
      those programs in the courses through projects involving laser cutting, 3D
      printing, digital design and animation, and more.

        I made a baseball game for my final project of COMP 112. The video above
        shows the gameplay for a single game. Users have the option to input
        their team name and the length of the series before the fun begins.
        Every game the user squares off against the Pythons, where the user can
        only play offense. Each pitch is a random number between 1 and 25. The
        player must guess the random number and is rewarded with a home run for
        a correct guess, or with another type of hit if their entry is close to
        the target number. If the guess is too far off, then the player is given
        an out. There are no walks or strikeouts, but the player has the option
        to sacrifice bunt (there is an 80% chance that the bunt safely advances
        the baserunners). The user recieves an update of the score and their
        batting average after each inning. Records are also kept; after each
        game and series the user is prompted with their statistics and shown how
        they match up against the all-time bests for a series of the same
        length.

    <h3>The Climber</h3>

      <p>
        In the climber project our task was to design and electromechanical body
        that climbs across a horizontally placed ladder (essentially monkey
        bars). The body was only allowed to grab onto the rungs of the ladder,
        not the side rails. Unlike the hopper project, there were no strict
        material limitations. My team's final design goal was to have our
        climber transition from rung to rung by 180-degree flips with the help
        of a mechanism that shifts its center of mass. As can be seen in the
        video, the climber intially shifts to the left so it unhooks from the
        left rung. Then the initial right arm pulls the body up as high as the
        small motor will allow. The additional weight is then shifted to the
        left of the attached arm, allowing for the body to be pulled high enough
        for the hanging arm to reach the subsequent rung. The idea was for this
        process to repeat for the length of the ladder; however, there was an
        issue with our weight-shifting mechanism. The rack we used allowed the
        additional weight to be located outside the frame of the climber on only
        one side, an asymmetry in the design. This issue meant that the flip
        could only work on one side, thus our climber could not traverse the
        full ladder. Our next step would have been to change the rack and weight
        combination to be symmetric, which would allow for climbing on both
        sides. Other items we considered adding were whisker switches or force
        sensors. Those would have provided live feedback and significantly
        decreased the risk of a timing failure that was present in the "blind
        reckoning" method we used in our code.

        I had a great time in IDEA 175 my freshman year; this course
        strengthened my desire to pursue the IDEAS minor. Over the course of the
        semester I became introduced to circuitry, Arduino, Solidworks, laser
        cutting, and 3D printing. I credit this course and my final project to
        my current love of 3D printing.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the many mini-projects we were assigned throughout the semester
        was line following. The task was to use an IR LED/detector and our
        knowledge of Arduino to have our robot car follow a path given by a dark
        line. The paths varied in difficulty, and I included a sample of one in
        the above video. As can be seen in the video, when the sensor was over
        light (white) space I had the car turn left, and when it was over dark
        (black) space I had it turn right. This basic solution was successful
        for every path except for the one that had "extreme" difficulty &mdash;
        that one required a few modifications. The exercise allowed me to become
        more comfortable with Arduino coding and also taught me a lesson about
        the power of simplicity in design.

      </p>
      <p>
        The final project for HIST 176 was to write a research paper that was
        grounded in locally available archival sources. After discussions with
        Professor Erickson, I arrived at my topic of Dr. Vernet Eaton. I was
        fascinated with what I found because I had previously never heard of Dr.
        Eaton; he does not seem to be well-known in the Wesleyan physics
        department. Unlike the typical noteworthy physicist, Eaton's legacy lies
        in his contributions to physics education, not research. In 1955, Dr.
        Eaton was awarded the Oersted Medal for his "notable contributions to
        the teaching of physics." The Oersted Medal is the highest award
        presented by the American Associastion of Physics Teachers and has been
        given to many renowned physicists such as Dr. Richard Feynman. Dr.
        Eaton's pedagogical prominence was displayed on the national scale when
        he joined NBC's TV show <em>Continental Classroom</em> as part of a
        national effort to teach americans physics during the Cold War. In
        addition to his national accolades, Dr. Eaton had a lasting impact on
        Wesleyan and the greater Middletown community.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first section of my paper outlines a breif history of physics at
        Wesleyan from its inception to the time of Dr. Eaton. Physics education
        on the national scale at the time is also discussed. The second section
        of the paper is centered on Dr. Eaton. I review his ideas and
        contributions regarding the demonstration lecture and introductory
        laboratory course, while also examining his enduring impact on physics
        education.

        The assignment was to first generate a collection of images
        representative of a clearly defined category. Then, we were asked to
        isolate an object from each image using techniques we learned in
        Photoshop. After extracting the objects, we were instructed to arrange

        My collection is composed of photos that captured memorable moments in
        professional athletics. The background is a photo taken during the
        infamous power outage amid Super Bowl XLVII. I chose images from the
        2001 MLB World Series, 2010 NHL Stanley Cup Finals, 2014-15 NFL Super
        Bowl, 2016 NBA Finals, and more. The objects I selected were all taken
        from the losers of the competitions. For example: Russel Wilson's arm
        moments before his goal-line pass was intercepted to end Super Bowl
        XLIX.

        Our assignment was to create a seamless animated loop based on a poster
        from
        <a href="https://www.loc.gov/pictures/collection/wpapos/"
          >The Library of Congress's Print and Photographs Division collection
          of WPA posters</a
        >. We were first assigned to make a perfect copy of the poster in
        Illustrator. Upon completing the first step, we were instructed to craft
        a looping animation that brought our perfect copy to life.

        The assignment that I chose for my final project was to "imagine a
        future using an approach framed by the speculative design methods
        introduced in the course." My imagined future took the form of a brief
        animated video. The animation required many skills we acquired
        throughout the course such as isolating objects in Photoshop, creating a
        perfect copy with Illustrator, animation with After Effects, and more.

        The assignment was to select a digital artist and create a presentation
        that includes the artist's biography, exhibition history, and career
        work. We were asked to identify some of the major themes, techniques,
        and art historical conversations with which the artist is engaged.

        I chose Jonathan Monaghan because I found his digital animations to be
        mesmerizing. You can view pieces of his work

        The truss project was a fun way to end the IDEA 210 course. The video
        above shows our truss in action; the iteration shown failed under a load
        of 113.5 pounds. We undertook many other stimulating projects throughout
        the semester: our laboratory exercises covered many interesting topics
        such as material classification, failure modes, and failure testing.
