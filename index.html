    <h1>Welcome to my homepage!</h1>
    <p>
      Hello! I am Jimmy Clifford. I was born and raised in Lutz, FL and enrolled
      at Wesleyan University in the fall of 2019. The past four years at
      Wesleyan have been incredible, and I am thankful for the opportunity to
      stay for another year as part of the BA/MA program. While at Wesleyan I
      have majored in mathematics and physics, minored in materials science and
      engineering, and started at catcher for the varsity baseball team. My MA
      degree will be in physics with my research area being molecular collision
      dynamics. After I earn the MA degree in the spring of 2024, I plan on
      matriculating into a PhD program in Physics, Applied Physics, or Applied
      Math.
    </p>
    <p>
      Below I have included a couple pictures of myself and some information
      about this website. I encourage you to contact me at
      jclifford@wesleyan.edu if you have any questions.

      baseball season.

      Univeristy of Notre Dame's particle accelerator facility for my summer
      internship at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.
